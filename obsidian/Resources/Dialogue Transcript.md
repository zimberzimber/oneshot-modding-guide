There's a web page featuring most of vanilla OneShot's dialogue:
https://hunternet93.github.io/OneShot-Dialog-Transcript/dialog.html

It's not perfect as it doesn't cover text from common events or scripts, but it's still a very useful reference, especially if you've already modified some dialogue and are looking for the original.

#TODO : Update the transcript to include common events, or just make a better solution people could apply to their mods
