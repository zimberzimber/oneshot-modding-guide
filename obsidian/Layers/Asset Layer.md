This layer covers the assets, like sprites, audio, and pictures.

If your mod is purely modifying existing assets, like redrawing the entirety of the game in MS Paint and bitcrushing all the audio, then you need not delve further.

Otherwise you must also delve into the [[Editor Layer]] for the game to use new assets.


## Requirements
- Tools for modifying the assets you want to modify
- [[Editor Layer]], if you intend to add new assets


## Just Replacing Assets
Simply replace or modify the assets in the game's files.
Make sure the names and locations of files match to those of the assets they intend to replace.

Note that you have some control over the [[Journal App]] if you want to modify its pages, without needing anything else.
See its page for more details.


## Adding New Assets
Same as you'd be adding them in any RPG Maker game.
