OneShot's core engine is a fork of MKXP, which is an open source rewrite of the RPG Maker XP engine, written in C++.

MKXP repository: https://github.com/Ancurio/mkxp
OneShot's fork: https://github.com/elizagamedev/mkxp-oneshot

There are other versions out there which further expand the functionality of the engine, but you'll have to look it up.
