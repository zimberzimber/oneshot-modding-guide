The RPG Maker series suffers a chronic case of "evolving backwards" since (at least) the 2003 release.

This can be observed even within RPG Maker XP itself, where the `1.02` version, is superior to the latest `1.05` version.
The main difference being that `1.02` doesn't have clunky and needlessly limiting textboxes like `1.05` does.

Sadly I can't help you with getting it, so you're on your own.
