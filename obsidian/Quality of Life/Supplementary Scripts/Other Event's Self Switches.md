You can get another event's self switch with this in a script command:
`get_others_self_switch("other_event_name", "A")`
This will look for an event named `other_event_name`, and return whether its `A` self switch is on or not.

You can also change it with:
`set_others_self_switch("other_event_name", "A", true)`
Look for an event named `other_event_name`, and set its `A` self switch to `ON`.

Here's an example on how to use them:
![[other_events_self_switches_1.mp4]]
![[other_events_self_switches_2.mp4]]
