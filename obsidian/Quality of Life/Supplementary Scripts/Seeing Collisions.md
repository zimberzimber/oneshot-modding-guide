Testing your maps to ensure there aren't any holes that shouldn't be there can be tedious, because the vanilla method is bumping into every wall and hoping it doesn't let you through.

With this script, you can simply have the game draw impassable tiles with the click of a button:
![[seeing_collisions_1.mp4]]

It requires [[Debug Mode]], and can be toggled on/off with the `R` action, which is the `W` key by default.
