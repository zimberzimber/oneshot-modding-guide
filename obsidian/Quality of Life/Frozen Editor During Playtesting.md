You'll notice that the editor is frozen while playtesting the game from within the editor.
This makes going back and forth between the game and editor to correct things really tedious, as you can't make changes while the game is running.

Thankfully, this only happens if you launch the game from the editor.
Launching the game's `.exe` from the folder instead of the editor completely avoid the freezing, so you can use the editor while the game is running.
