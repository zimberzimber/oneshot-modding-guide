This page contains useful information for players, which modders should also know about.

## In Game Timer
You can enable the in game speedrun timer by adding a file named `igt.ini` next to the game's `.exe`.


## True Save Reset
1) Navigate to `%appdata%/Oneshot`
2) Delete `save.dat` and `p-settings.dat`
3) Disable cloud sync if playing the game/mod through Steam

Mods may have a different save directory, or not have a save at all.
For example:
- **Fading Memory:** `%appdata%/OSFM`, requires disabling Steam cloud sync
- **Frostide:** `%appdata%/Oneshot_frostide` 
- **Metamorphosis:** Doesn't save


## Save Issues
Some mods may use the vanilla game save directory, causing issues once the mod is uninstalled.
If launching **clean, vanilla OneShot** displays an error, follow the save reset steps, and try again.
If launching a mod displays an error, seek help from the mod's developers or community.

See [[Save Directory]] if you're a mod maker - It's very important.


## Save Generator
hat_kid made a web page where you can generate a vanilla OneShot save file at certain states and/or a different player name:

## Installing Mods
It's the same with the itch.io version, you just navigate to the game's directory yourself instead of through Steam.

## Uninstalling Mods
With the itch.io version, you just delete the game files and redownload them from Itch.
