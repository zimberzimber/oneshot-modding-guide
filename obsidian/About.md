This guide serves to give readers some understanding of OneShot 2016 modding, and be a repository of knowledge and some resources.

This is not an RPG Maker guide, a scripting guide, nor a general game development guide.
This guide covers information specific to OneShot, sometimes touching upon related topics, or link to external resources.
Despite that, what you learn here may serve you with other games as well.


## Lost or Uncertain?

**Look for answers in vanilla first.**
It's a very helpful reference for what you can do and how.
This applies to any kind of modding, not just OneShot.

If that doesn't help, start looking for answer on the web, or asking other people.
Most problems you'll run into will probably be either RPG Maker or Ruby specific, so don't limit your search to just OneShot.
At worst, you'll be told that your problem is specific to OneShot, which will help narrowing down your search.

And don't be shy to share you experience with others in need of help!
Propagate your knowledge and offer guidance where you're able, so that everyone can have an easier time realizing their ideas, and expressing their love for this silly not-a-cat game!


## Guide Assumptions
The guide assumes you have some RPG Maker knowledge, although you can learn it as you mod.
Some things can be done even without the editor, like translation or asset swaps.

The guide assumes you're using the Windows operating system.

The guide assumes you can see file extensions, like the `.exe` in `oneshot.exe`.
Look up how to enable them if they're not visible.
